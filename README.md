# Why Rust?

An introduction for Managers, Decision Makers and Technical Leads.

## Introduction

In our half-day course on *Why Rust?* you will learn what Rust is about, where
it is from and where it is going, and whether it is right for you to look at
Rust for your next project. Includes two interactive lectures, an extended live
programming demonstration, and a Q&A session. We also provide a list of
resources and places you can go for support and advice on taking your next
steps.

We conduct all training sessions remotely using modern video-conferencing tools
to ensure the best learning experience.
