# What does Rust cost?

---

## Rust is Open Source

* Under the MIT or Apache-2.0 licences
* You can compile `rustc` and `cargo` yourself
* <github.com/rust-lang/rust>

---

## Binaries are provided free of charge

* Available using the `rustup` tool
* AWS sponsor the project
* Nothing to sign, no USB dongle required

---

## Support is available

* There are lots of places you can go for help
  * Forums, Discord, Reddit
  * Professional consulting firms
* There will soon be a *premium* Rust compiler with a support contract

---

## No-one is an expert overnight

* Budget for some training
* Budget for some time for the team to gain experience
* (More on this later...)

---

## You might need a bigger computer...

> Today, compiling the __Rust compiler__ on a 4-core CPU, that is typically
> found in a standard laptop, takes up to 15 minutes with another 5-10 minutes
> for tests. However, a 96-core cloud virtual machine can complete the same
> build in less than five minutes with tests completing in 35 seconds.

* The faster your checks run, the more productive you are!
* Rust does a lot of work *up front*
* Raspberry Pi 4 technically works, but it takes a while...
